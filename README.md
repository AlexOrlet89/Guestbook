# Thoughts and Prairs

Alright, Father, give us courage to change what must be altered, serenity to accept what cannot be helped, and the insight to know the one from the other.

"/" is going to be the list of entries.... yeh.

We're using our user.js fetch function directly in our context.

Private Route was added not without reinventing the wheel.

lets add a logout function to further prove this shit works, because I'm proving my private route works by ! my user and getting redirected. I think i can add logout to my userContext and add it to Home that way.. inshallah.

## Rubric

Use a custom hook to expose our context state for reading/writing 1
// find out what this means
Use the user context state in at least 2 components (e.g. header and entry list) 2
//NEXT UP!! USER CONTEXT IN HEADER, NOW FOR ENTRY! TECHNICALLY THESE ARE DONE BUT TA MIGHT WANT ME TO REFACTOR LIST AND FORM HERE, FIND OUT NEXT TIME WE SEE ONE
Guestbook entry uses the email stored in context for the name 2
// this is also technically done, but check with TAs
Behavior testing for EntryList view 2
Deployed on Netlify with CI passing
